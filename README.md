# Voice Recorder and Analyzer

This Python project records a short audio clip from your microphone, saves it as a `.wav` file, and then visualizes both its **waveform** and **frequency spectrum**.

# Features
* Records audio from the default microphone 🎙️
* Saves recording as `myvoice.wav`
* Plots the **time-domain waveform** of the audio
* Computes and plots the **frequency spectrum** using FFT
